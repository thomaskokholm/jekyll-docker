But the commands are:
=============================
When I need to create a site first? (aka I have an empty "site" folder at root)

just add a environment variable to the run command to tell the container to make one:

docker run -p 8081:4000 -v .:/site -e JEKYLL_NEW=true bretfisher/jekyll-serve
------------------------
When I want to run the site again after making changes (or git pull)

docker run -p 8081:4000 -v .:/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve
